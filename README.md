# obsidian-prioritization-wellness-tracker
This is a simple planner for Obsidian MD that allows users to use frontmatter data to prioritize their day and week using a clean and simple UI.  It requires the JS Engine, Meta Bind and Google Calendar plugins to be installed.  May support e-mail reminders and Outlook (or other e-mail providers) in the future.
